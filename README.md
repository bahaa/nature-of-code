Implementation for some of the algorithms and samples in The Nature of Code book by Daniel Shiffman.

The book is available for [free](http://natureofcode.com/).

These samples use [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) for Canvas drawing.

You can see a live version of the samples [here](http://bahaa.github.io/nature-of-code/).
